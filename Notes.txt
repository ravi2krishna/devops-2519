    -> DevOps 

        -> What Is DevOps ?

           -> DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy. 
            
            -> It breaks down the traditional silos between Development & Operations Teams

        -> Why DevOps ?

            -> DevOps unites software development and IT operations 
            to "deliver software faster" and more "reliably"

    -> Application 

        -> Development 

            -> To Build Applications We need Roles Like 

                -> Software Architect 
                -> System Engineer
                -> Software Developers 
                -> Software Testers 
                -> etc 

        -> Operations

            -> To Build Infrastructure & Maintain Applications, We need Roles Like 

                -> System Admin 
                -> Network Admin 
                -> Cloud Admin 
                -> Security Admin 
                -> etc 

    -> Application Delivery / Deployment  

        -> Developed -> Deploy On Servers  

    -> Development (Skill set)

        -> System Design    
        -> Programming Language 
        -> Testing Tools

    -> Operations (Skill set)

        -> Linux / Windows Administration (RHCA)
        -> Networking - CCNA 
        -> Cloud Admin 

    -> DevOps Engineer 

        -> DevOps Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS"
            so that organizations can BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY (Delivery Line) Softwares
            "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"

                -> "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS" ?

                -> BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY ? 

                -> "FASTER" & "RELIABLE" ?

    -> "DevOps Practices" ==> "Tools"

        -> Version Control Systems (VCS) ==> "Git" & "GitHub" 

            -> Tracking Code Over Time 

            -> Maintain different versions of code base 

            -> As DevOps Engineer, you are responsible for Writing "Scripts"

        -> Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI-CD) ==> "Jenkins" 

            -> Application Life Cycle (SDLC)

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> Test -> Deploy -> Maintain 

                -> The Above Process is Redundant / Repetitive 

                    -> We need Automation, which can be implemented using CI-CD 

        -> Containerization ("FASTER") ==> "Docker"

            -> Universal Packages i.e Portability 

            -> Universal Package As Application (Docker Images)

        -> Orchestration ("RELIABLE") ==> "Kubernetes"

            -> Helps Run Applications 24/7 without "DOWNTIME"

            -> Setup Production Environments

                -> Production Environments should be RELIABLE


    -> DevOps Prerequisites 

        -> Servers (*) (AWS & AZURE)

        -> Linux (*) [ Command Line Interface - CLI ]

        -> Application Life Cycle [ Project ]

    -> DevOps Practices & Tools

============

    -> Servers

        -> A server is a "computer system" that provides data, services or resources
            to other computers, known as "clients" over a network. 

        -> Physical Server 

            -> Consists of Hardware + Operating System (Linux OS : Ubuntu)

        -> Server Softwares 

            -> Web Server : Hosts and Serves Web Pages / Web Apps Over Internet 

                -> Examples : Apache Web Server, Nginx Web Server, IIS Server etc 

            -> Database Server : Hosts Application Data & Transactions 

                -> Examples : MySQL Server, Postgres Server, MS SQL Server etc 

            -> Email Server : Custom Email Server for Promotional Email Blasts 

                -> Examples : Postfix Server, Pop3, SendMail etc 

            -> DevOps Context 

                -> DevOps Engineers deploys and configures web servers, email severs etc 
                    to ensure High Availability, Performance, Security etc 


    -> To Get Servers 

        -> Purchasing servers is first step in setting up Infrastructure for

            -> Hosting Web Sites / Web Apps 

            -> Hosting Storage 

            -> Hosting Databases 

        -> Servers are Quite Costly and from learning perspective we cannot afford server 

        -> Rather than Purchasing servers, we want to "RENT SERVERS"

    -> Buying Server == Buying Bike 

    -> Rent Server == Rent Bike (Ola, Rapido, Uber etc )

    -> Rent Server ?? 

        -> AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI, Alibaba Cloud etc 

        -> Above vendors offers IT Infrastructure On RENT 

    -> Cloud Computing 

        -> Cloud Computing refers to ON-DEMAND Availability Of Compute Power(CPU),
            Database Storage, Networks and other IT Resources through cloud providers 
            (AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI, Alibaba Cloud etc) via "INTERNET" with 
            "PAY AS YOU GO" model of pricing 

        -> Cloud providers offers their services 

            -> IAAS - Infrastructure As A Service (Hardware)
            -> PAAS - Platform As A Service (Runtimes(java,python etc), databases, etc)
            -> SAAS - Software As A Service (Direct Softwares : Monitoring Softwares, Backup Softwares etc)

        -> We will implement servers on 
            
            -> AWS Cloud - FREE TRAIL - 6 Months (Limited Access -> Beyond Limits then Pay)

=============

    -> Using AWS or AZURE or Any Other Cloud provider doesn't make any difference moving forward 

    -> Using gmail.com on Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc we get same outcome 

    -> We are using Linux Severs which has only CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> CLI - Command Line Interface

        -> CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with Servers, through 
            "text based commands" 

        -> CLI helps Automate Repetitive Tasks 

    -> Hardware & System Software(OS) Commands 

        -> CPU Info

        -> Application(Commands) -> Shell -> Kernel -> Hardware 

        -> Shell : Command Line Interpreter, that translates commands entered 
            by users and converts them into a Language that Kernel can understand 

            -> BASH - Bourne Again Shell 

                -> ps -ef 
                -> echo $SHELL 

        -> Kernel : The Linux kernel is the central component of the 
            Linux operating system. 

            -> uname -r 

    -> Linux File System 

        -> A Linux file system is a hierarchical, "tree-like" structure 
        that organizes data and manages how it is stored on storage devices. 
        It is unified into a "single" structure, starting from the 
        root directory (/), which is the top of the hierarchy. 
        
        -> Key directories include /bin (binaries), /etc (configuration files), 
        /home (user directories), and /var (variable data like logs). 

        -> My computer                  -> root directory (/)

    -> Common directories
        / (root): The top-level directory of the entire file system.
        /bin: Contains essential command-line binaries (programs).
        /boot: Contains files needed for the boot process, such as the kernel and bootloader.
        /dev: Contains device files that represent hardware devices.
        /etc: Contains system-wide configuration files.
        /home: Contains the home directories for regular users.
        /lib: Holds system libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin.
        /opt: For optional software packages.
        /tmp: Temporary files, which are often deleted upon reboot.
        /usr: Contains most user utilities and applications.
        /var: Variable data, such as logs and temporary files that are kept between reboots. 

    -> ls : lists directory content 

    -> pwd : present working directory 

    -> man : manual pages for commands like a helper utility to know about command 

    -> mkdir : create directory 

    -> touch : create empty file 

    -> cat : to read file data only, not directories 

    -> cd : change directory 

    -> cd ~ : change to home directory
