    -> DevOps 

        -> What Is DevOps ?

           -> DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy. 
            
            -> It breaks down the traditional silos between Development & Operations Teams

        -> Why DevOps ?

            -> DevOps unites software development and IT operations 
            to "deliver software faster" and more "reliably"

    -> Application 

        -> Development

            so that organizations can BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY (Delivery Line) Softwares
            "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"

                -> "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS" ?

                -> BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY ? 

                -> "FASTER" & "RELIABLE" ?

    -> "DevOps Practices" ==> "Tools"

            -> Hosting Web Sites / Web Apps 

            -> Hosting Storage 

            -> Hosting Databases 

        -> Servers are Quite Costly and from learning perspective we cannot afford server 

        -> Rather than Purchasing servers, we want to "RENT SERVERS"

    -> Buying Server == Buying Bike 

    -> Rent Server == Rent Bike (Ola, Rapido, Uber etc )

    -> Rent Server ?? 

        -> AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI, Alibaba Cloud etc 

        -> Above vendors offers IT Infrastructure On RENT

        -> Cloud Computing refers to ON-DEMAND Availability Of Compute Power(CPU),
            Database Storage, Networks and other IT Resources through cloud providers 
            (AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI, Alibaba Cloud etc) via "INTERNET" with 
            "PAY AS YOU GO" model of pricing 

        -> Cloud providers offers their services 

            -> IAAS - Infrastructure As A Service (Hardware)
            -> PAAS - Platform As A Service (Runtimes(java,python etc), databases, etc)
            -> SAAS - Software As A Service (Direct Softwares : Monitoring Softwares, Backup Softwares etc)

    -> Using AWS or AZURE or Any Other Cloud provider doesn't make any difference moving forward 

    -> Using gmail.com on Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc we get same outcome 

    -> We are using Linux Severs which has only CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> CLI - Command Line Interface

        -> CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with Servers, through

    -> Linux Architecture 

        -> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/linux_architecture.jpg

        -> Application(Commands) -> Shell -> Kernel -> Hardware 

        -> Shell : Command Line Interpreter, that translates commands entered 
            by users and converts them into a Language that Kernel can understand 

            -> BASH - Bourne Again Shell 

                -> ps -ef 
                -> echo $SHELL 

        -> Kernel : The Linux kernel is the central component of the 
            Linux operating system. 

            -> uname -r 

    -> Linux File System 

        -> A Linux file system is a hierarchical, "tree-like" structure 
        that organizes data and manages how it is stored on storage devices. 
        It is unified into a "single" structure, starting from the 
        root directory (/), which is the top of the hierarchy. 
        
        -> Key directories include /bin (binaries), /etc (configuration files), 
        /home (user directories), and /var (variable data like logs). 

        -> My computer                  -> root directory (/)

        / (root): The top-level directory of the entire file system.
        /bin: Contains essential command-line binaries (programs).
        /boot: Contains files needed for the boot process, such as the kernel and bootloader.
        /dev: Contains device files that represent hardware devices.
        /etc: Contains system-wide configuration files.
        /home: Contains the home directories for regular users.
        /lib: Holds system libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin.
        /opt: For optional software packages.
        /tmp: Temporary files, which are often deleted upon reboot.
        /usr: Contains most user utilities and applications.
        /var: Variable data, such as logs and temporary files that are kept between reboots. 

    -> ls : lists directory content 

    -> pwd : present working directory 

    -> man : manual pages for commands like a helper utility to know about command 

    -> mkdir : create directory 

    -> touch : create empty file 

    -> cat : to read file data only, not directories 

    -> cd : change directory 

    -> cd ~ : change to home directory

            -> touch hello.txt

        -> vi modes 

            -> vi existing_file_name 

            -> vi hello.txt

            -> "i" - insert mode 
            -> "esc" - command mode 

            -> :w - means write data to file
            -> :wq - means write data to file and quit file 

            -> vi new_file_name (creates file also)

            -> q! - exit file without saving i.e discard changes in file 

    -> sudo 

        -> sudo - super user do 

        -> super user means "root" user, who has highest privileges in server 

        -> sudo command (running the command with root user i.e no permission issues)

        -> sudo == Run as Administrator in win

        -> whoami 

        -> sudo whoami 

    -> File Operations 

        -> copy files & directories 

            -> file 

                -> cp source_file <destination_directory>
                -> cp hello.txt aws

    -> Installations 

        -> In windows download exe file & install exe 
        -> In Ubuntu download deb file & install deb 

        -> How To Download ?

            -> wget <link-to-download>

        -> Download zip deb file 

            -> wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zip/zip_3.0-12build2_amd64.deb

        -> Install downloaded deb file

            -> zip 

            -> sudo dpkg -i zip_3.0-12build2_amd64.deb

            -> zip 

        -> Another Approach To Install Softwares 

            -> In windows we have microsoft store  

                -> it's like play store i.e search and install (no explicit download)

            -> In Ubuntu we have apt package manager (no explicit download needed)

                -> sudo apt install <package> 

                -> unzip 

                -> sudo apt install unzip 

                -> unzip 

        -> zipping files & folders (Archive)

            -> zip file.zip -r dir1 dir2 file1 file2 etc 

        -> unzip (Extract)

            -> unzip file.zip

        -> There is an inbuilt tool called "tar" which can do Archive & Extract 

            -> Archive 

                -> tar -cf file.tar dir1 dir2 file1 file2 etc 

            -> Extract

                -> tar -xf file.tar

=============

    -> User Management 

        -> User 

            -> A user logins to the server and performs some task 

        -> Types Of Users 

            -> root user : root has all elevated privileges(can do anything) in terms of permissions 

                    : no restrictions 

            -> system users : users that are created when we install some softwares or 
                              users that come with os (id is below 1000)

            -> regular users : created by admins, clouds which are like human entities
                                admins, developers etc 

        -> How to know, which account you logged in  

            -> whoami 
        
        -> Check if users exists in the server 

            -> id username 
            -> id root 
            -> id ravi
            -> id john

        -> Check all users in server

            -> cat /etc/passwd 

        -> Switch user accounts 

            -> sudo su - username

            -> sudo su - root 
            -> sudo su - sys # This account is currently not available.
            -> sudo su - bin # This account is currently not available.

            -> NOTE: above users sys, bin like system users don't have bash access(so no login)

        -> Adding User Accounts

            -> sudo adduser username
            -> sudo adduser ravi
            -> id ravi (user id is above 1000)
            -> grep pattern_to_find filename 
                -> grep commands helps in filtering 
            -> grep ravi /etc/passwd
            -> sudo su - ravi

        -> Grant regular users login access from outside the server 

            -> AWS 

                -> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf

                -> Set PasswordAuthentication to yes

                -> Restart ssh service using 

                    -> sudo systemctl restart ssh 

            -> AZURE 

                -> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf

                -> Set PasswordAuthentication to yes

                -> Restart ssh service using 

                    -> sudo systemctl restart ssh 

            -> Then Login to servers using below command 

                -> ssh username@ip 
                -> ssh ravi@ip
                -> ssh john@ip

            -> Understanding Server Privileges with user accounts 

                -> using ubuntu user
                    
                    -> ls /opt
                    -> touch /opt/ubuntu.txt
                    -> sudo touch /opt/ubuntu.txt
                    -> ls /opt

                    -> ls /opt

            -> NOTE: To know sudoers, check with below command 

                -> sudo grep sudo /etc/group

                -> sudo deluser --remove-home snow  
                -> ls /home


    -> Group Management 

        -> Group 

            -> A group is a logical collection of users

            -> Groups are for organizing permissions in better way, rather than going 
                with individual user accounts 

            -> Checking Groups in server

                -> cat /etc/group 

            -> Every Group user we create has a group with same name and it's called primary group 

            -> You can add your own secondary groups, using 

                -> sudo addgroup groupname 
                -> sudo grep developers /etc/group 
                -> sudo addgroup developers 
                -> sudo grep developers /etc/group 

            -> Adding users to group 

                -> sudo usermod -aG group username
                -> sudo usermod -aG developers ravi
                -> sudo usermod -aG developers john
                -> sudo grep developers /etc/group 

            -> Deleting users from group 

                -> sudo gpasswd -d username group 

            -> Delete Groups 

                -> sudo groupdel groupname 

                -> sudo addgroup dummy  
                -> sudo grep dummy /etc/group 
                -> sudo groupdel dummy 
                -> sudo grep dummy /etc/group 

    -> Permissions 

        -> Permissions are grants that we apply to owners(users), groups and others.

        -> Working with permissions, helps you understand, why we are getting 
            permission denied error

            -> touch /opt/hey.txt

                -> touch: cannot touch '/opt/hey.txt': Permission denied

            -> touch ~/hey.txt 

                -> No permission issues, but why ?? 
            
        -> To understand permissions

            -> touch hello.txt 
            -> ls -l 

                -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 13 Nov 17 04:19 hello.txt

            -> -rw-rw-r-- (indicates permissions)
            -> ubuntu ubuntu (user group)

            -> -rw-rw-r-- (first - is file)
            
            -> rw- rw- r-- (permissions)

                rw- : user / owner 
                rw- : group 
                r-- : others 

                r : read ==> w : write ==> x : execute

=============

    -> We Start With Building Project

    -> SDLC 

        -> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process followed by 
            software development teams to design, develop and test high-quality software. 

        -> The SDLC consists of multiple stages such as Requirement Gathering, Analysis, Design, 
            Code, Test, Deploy and Maintain.

    -> Version Control Systems (VCS)

        -> Version control / Revision control / Source control is a process that helps to 
            keep track of changes made to a file or a set of files 
            (computer programs, web site files, documents etc) over time.

        -> Advantage Of VCS is Revert Changes To Previous Working Versions, 
            if there are issues in new version

        -> Git - Client Side Software     - Developer 

            -> Git a tool to implement VSC 

            -> Git helps in tracking code / changes in your code 

            -> Git tracks code in your laptop 

        -> GitHub - Server Side Software  - Organizations

            -> GitHub provides a platform to store code 

            -> GitHub Stores All Versions Of Code in centralized location (github.com)


        -> Developer -> Git -> GitHub 

        -> Repository 

            -> A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. 
                Developers can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

        -> JIRA 

            -> Jira is a proprietary product developed by Atlassian that allows 
                bug tracking, issue tracking and agile project management. 
        
        -> GitHub Projects & Issues 

            -> GitHub Projects are a feature within GitHub designed for planning and tracking work

            -> GitHub Issues is a built-in, lightweight issue-tracking system in every repository 
                used for planning, discussing, and tracking work like 
                bug reports, new features, and tasks.

            -> NOTE: Within Project we have Issues 

        
        -> Git Workflow 

            -> A Git Workflow is a defined set of practices and processes that a team follows 
            to collaborate and manage changes to their codebase using Git. 

            -> It defines how branches, commits, merges, and other Git features are 
                used to ensure an efficient and organized development process. 


1. Branches
Branching is a core concept in Git where a separate line of development is created, allowing developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
Common branch types include:
Main (Master) Branch: The primary and stable branch, often used for production-ready code.
Feature Branches: Created for developing new features. These branches are typically merged back into the main branch after the work is completed.
Hotfix Branches: Used to fix bugs in the main branch, especially in production.
Release Branches: Created to prepare for a new release, allowing final touches, testing, and bug fixes before merging into the main branch.

2. Commits
A commit in Git is a snapshot of changes made to the code. Each commit records who made the change, what was changed, and when.
Commits should be small, focused, and meaningful, allowing easy tracking and rollback if necessary.

3. Merging
Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
Merges can be:
Fast-forward: When there is no divergence, and the target branch simply moves forward to the tip of the merged branch.
Three-way merge: When there are divergent changes, Git creates a new commit that combines the changes.
Merge conflicts occur when changes in different branches are incompatible, requiring manual resolution.

4. Pull Requests (PR)
A Pull Request is a feature offered by platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, where developers can request to merge their branch into another (usually the main branch).
PRs allow for code review, discussion, and testing before merging, ensuring code quality and minimising bugs.

5. Rebasing
Rebasing is another way to integrate changes from one branch into another.
Instead of creating a merge commit, rebasing re-applies commits from one branch onto another as if they were created sequentially, resulting in a linear history.

6. Staging Area
The staging area is where changes are reviewed and prepared before committing. This allows developers to control exactly what gets included in a commit.

Common Git Workflows
1. Centralised Workflow
Single Branch (Master/Main): Everyone works directly on the main branch.
Usage: Simple projects or small teams.
Pros: Easy to understand.
Cons: High risk of conflicts, less control over changes.

2. Feature Branch Workflow
Branches: Each feature or bug fix is developed in its own branch.
Usage: Medium to large teams.
Pros: Isolated development, easier collaboration, and safer code integration.
Cons: Requires good branch management.

3. Gitflow Workflow
Branches: Includes main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches.
Usage: Complex projects with multiple release cycles.
Pros: Structured release management, clear branch roles.
Cons: Complex branch management, not ideal for continuous deployment.

4. Forking Workflow
Fork: Each developer has a personal copy (fork) of the repository.
Usage: Open-source projects or teams working on the same base code but needing different variations.
Pros: Complete isolation, contributors can experiment freely.
Cons: More complex collaboration, harder to manage multiple forks.


1. Owner
The Owner is the person who owns the repository, often responsible for setting up the project, managing permissions, and overseeing the overall codebase.
The owner creates the repository and can add other developers as collaborators.

2. Repository
A Repository (repo) is a storage location for your project. It contains all the files and their version history.
The repository is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, enabling multiple developers to work on the project.

3. Main Branch
The Main Branch (often named main or master) is the primary branch in a repository.
It contains the stable and production-ready code that should always be in a deployable state.
Changes to the main branch are carefully managed and reviewed to ensure stability.

4. Protect Main Branch
The owner can Protect the Main Branch to prevent direct pushes or unreviewed changes. This means:
Only certain users can make changes.
Changes can only be made via Pull Requests (PRs) that must be reviewed and approved.
Protection rules can include:
Requiring status checks to pass before merging.
Restricting who can push to the branch.

5. Developer
A Developer is someone working on the project. They are given access to the repository by the owner.
Developers do not work directly on the main branch; instead, they create feature branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or other tasks.

6. Dev Branch
The Dev Branch (or any feature branch) is created by the developer from the main branch.
This branch is where the developer writes code, commits changes, and tests new features.
The dev branch is often named after the feature or bug being addressed, e.g., feature/login-page or bugfix/header-issue.

7. Pull Request by Developer from Dev to Main Branch
Once the developer is satisfied with their changes, they open a Pull Request (PR).
The PR is a request to merge the changes from the dev branch into the main branch.
The PR contains a description of the changes, and any relevant information the owner/reviewers need to know.

8. Owner Review and Merge to Main Branch
The Owner (or other reviewers) reviews the Pull Request.
They may check:
Code quality and style.
If the changes introduce any bugs or issues.
Whether the changes align with the project goals.
The reviewer can request changes, approve, or reject the PR.
Once approved, the owner or authorized reviewer merges the dev branch into the main branch.
After merging, the main branch is updated with the new changes, and the dev branch can be deleted if it’s no longer needed.


Summary of the Workflow:
Owner creates and manages the Repository.
The Main Branch is protected to ensure stability.
A Developer creates a Dev Branch to work on new features or fixes.
The developer opens a Pull Request to merge changes from the dev branch to the main branch.
The Owner reviews the changes, and upon approval, merges them into the Main Branch.
