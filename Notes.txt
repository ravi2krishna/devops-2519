    -> DevOps 

        -> What Is DevOps ?

           -> DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy. 
            
            -> It breaks down the traditional silos between Development & Operations Teams

        -> Why DevOps ?

            -> DevOps unites software development and IT operations 
            to "deliver software faster" and more "reliably"

    -> Application 

        -> Development 

            -> To Build Applications We need Roles Like 

                -> Software Architect 
                -> System Engineer
                -> Software Developers 
                -> Software Testers 
                -> etc 

        -> Operations

            -> To Build Infrastructure & Maintain Applications, We need Roles Like 

                -> System Admin 
                -> Network Admin 
                -> Cloud Admin 
                -> Security Admin 
                -> etc 

    -> Application Delivery / Deployment  

        -> Developed -> Deploy On Servers  

    -> Development (Skill set)

        -> System Design    
        -> Programming Language 
        -> Testing Tools

    -> Operations (Skill set)

        -> Linux / Windows Administration (RHCA)
        -> Networking - CCNA 
        -> Cloud Admin 

    -> DevOps Engineer 

        -> DevOps Engineer will implement "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS"
            so that organizations can BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY (Delivery Line) Softwares
            "FASTER" & "RELIABLE"

                -> "DevOps Practices" using "TOOLS" ?

                -> BUILD, TEST & DEPLOY ? 

                -> "FASTER" & "RELIABLE" ?

    -> "DevOps Practices" ==> "Tools"

        -> Version Control Systems (VCS) ==> "Git" & "GitHub" 

            -> Tracking Code Over Time 

            -> Maintain different versions of code base 

            -> As DevOps Engineer, you are responsible for Writing "Scripts"

        -> Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI-CD) ==> "Jenkins" 

            -> Application Life Cycle (SDLC)

                -> Requirement -> Design -> Code -> Test -> Deploy -> Maintain 

                -> The Above Process is Redundant / Repetitive 

                    -> We need Automation, which can be implemented using CI-CD 

        -> Containerization ("FASTER") ==> "Docker"

            -> Universal Packages i.e Portability 

            -> Universal Package As Application (Docker Images)

        -> Orchestration ("RELIABLE") ==> "Kubernetes"

            -> Helps Run Applications 24/7 without "DOWNTIME"

            -> Setup Production Environments

                -> Production Environments should be RELIABLE


    -> DevOps Prerequisites 

        -> Servers (*) (AWS & AZURE)

        -> Linux (*) [ Command Line Interface - CLI ]

        -> Application Life Cycle [ Project ]

    -> DevOps Practices & Tools
